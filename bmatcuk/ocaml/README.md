# Multiples-of-3-and-5

A solution to [FPUGS/Multiples-of-3-and-5](https://github.com/FPUGS/Multiples-of-3-and-5) in OCaml.

OCaml is great because it has lots of imperative features that would make solving this problem super simple, but that's no fun. Instead, I've ignored the imperative features and implemented a solution using purely functional syntax.

## Run the Things!

1. [Install OCaml](https://ocaml.org/)
2. Make!
  
  ```bash
  make
  ```
3. Run!
  
  ```bash
  ./multiples
  ```

Wow! Such sums!
