# Multiples-of-3-and-5
## Project Euler Problem 1

_from https://projecteuler.net/problem=1_


````
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

solve this using any FP lang you want.  
Haskell, F#, Closure, Ocaml, Scala, Common Lisp, D, Erlang, etc.  
You can solve the same code kata in multiple languages by creating more braches.
